Frank Strong was a simple man. He enjoyed iced coffee, crisp fall morning air, and tending to his ant farm. While he loved to indulge in the small things in life, Frank worked long hours for a large software development company. He drove an hour and a half into the city to find himself crammed into the gloomy basement office every day. He didn't resent his job though. He loved to develop code and create things, so he didn't mind the working conditions.
Frank was known by several coworkers as the man to go to if you were really stuck on something. He may have been low on the totem pole, but he could solve most bugs given enough time. Several of his coworkers regularly visited him in the basement to chat or get advice on issues they were having. Many of them would even bring him a cup of coffee to sit next to the other empty cups on his desk that had been chugged in the late hours of the night. They would always joke that Frank was too nice for his own good since he never complained about the loud noises or constant interruptions from the cleaning staff or the multiple copy machines that sat across the room from him. His office was more of a corner in the janitorial closet located in the storeroom. Being downstairs, he had to take extra precautions to keep his electronics and computers off the damp floor and surfaces.
A lot of the office staff had this issue. Downstairs or not, the building was old and leaked something fierce. Many employees had to start over on their code or work after a computer fell victim to a newfound leak in the ceiling. Frank had plans to change all of that though. He was currently working on an app for all the office computers, maybe even something they could sell, that would detect moisture and start backing up and saving even open files onto the company servers in a matter of seconds. He was almost finished with it; he just needed to clean up the code a bit to make the package size as small as possible. But it was completely functional as is, and he was going to present it to his boss after he finished refactoring.
Philip Horn was charismatic, charming, even the office favorite with all the supervisors and bosses. He had every woman in the office wrapped around his finger, and all the men hung on every word like he was a superhero telling tales of adventure and crime fighting. He was also a software developer at the company, but since he was much less awkward, he managed to acquire a private office away from the cubical frustration. It was the dream office of many of his coworkers.
Frank didn't mind helping most people since he enjoyed the chats and company that came along with it. He was isolated in the basement, so he welcomed just about anyone into his tiny cave. Almost anyone. Philip was one person that constantly found himself in Frank's already crammed space because he couldn't find a way to fix rather simple bugs. Frank didn't mind this, he still liked having someone to talk to. The issues started when his supervisor started reprimanding him for taking up Philip's precious time. Nothing serious was ever done to him, but it killed his happy laid-back vibe that he tried to keep in the office.
Last month, Frank was putting the finishing touches on his new app when Philip walked in for the sixth time that day. Frank knew he would get an email at minimum about Philip being in his office, but trying to keep a good attitude he sighed and gave him a half-hearted smile. "Still couldn't get it to work?"
"No. I'm not sure what is wrong, but I tried reverting to the last commit like you said. Now Git won't let me commit anything else. It says something about needing to merge or something?" Philip grabbed a fold out chair leaned against the wall and pulled it up to Frank's desk before he could say anything else.
"I see. You probably just need to fix your merge conflicts and commit the fixes. Then it should be back to how it was. But I can remote into your computer. Did you leave it logged in?" Frank pulled up the software he used to remote control his coworkers' computers to help them fix things.
"No, was I supposed to?" Philip played mindlessly with the rubber ducky sitting next to Frank's monitor.
"Yeah, I think we had this issue last time too. No worries. I can log in. That should work fine." Frank bit his tongue as to not tell Philip he had mentioned this to him 17 times already in the last week, but who was counting?
He didn't bother logging off his own computer since Philip was always so mesmerized by the rubber ducky and his other trinkets he kept on his desk. Truthfully Philip probably wouldn't have been able to cause any issues on his task anyway since it required him to take several steps to start the program to begin with. He left his app minimized on his second screen since he was about to go on break anyway, that way he could quickly start the refactoring process and make the most of his short break.
It took roughly 20 minutes to get to Philips office and most of the way back down to the basement. Philip had one of the larger private offices on the fourth floor, and employees at Frank's level weren't allowed to use the elevator unless it was medically necessary. Unsurprisingly when he returned, Philip was already gone. Frank assumed he either decided to goof off for the rest of the day or go charm the secretary that Philip loved to flirt with. Neither was very uncommon for Philip, so Frank shrugged and sat back at his desk.
Weird. He thought to himself. I thought my app was minimized. Maybe I'm not getting enough sleep lately since I have spent many nights working on this.
The following Monday Frank pulled up his email, like he does every morning after setting down with his first iced coffee of the morning, scanning for anything from his supervisors. Sure enough, an email from Joe, his team lead, stood out from the inbox bursting with unread emails.
"Talk about a Goose laying a Golden Egg!"
As Frank chuckled to himself at how cheesy Joe's emails always were, his stomach dropped out of his chair when he opened the message.
"Thanks to the diligent work of one of our superstar employees, we can put away those lucky rabbits feet and pack up those umbrellas! Philip Horn has pitched an amazing idea to Mr. Mitchell and the other executives for an app that will help prevent water damage to our office computers as well as a backup system in case something were to go wrong. They are overjoyed at the idea and plan to implement the app company wide as soon as its completed. That's right! You heard me correctly! Company wide! Not just our branch, but every branch will be pitched the implementation after the app is complete. It won't be long now!"
Realization dawned on Frank, thinking back to the day Philip had come for help but then disappeared before Frank had returned. Seething with anger, he ran to Joe's office upstairs to set the record straight and explain the situation.
"I'm sorry Frank, truly I am. But I just can't believe Philip would do something like this. He really has this passion for making things to help people. He is going to change the world one day." Joe leaned back in his leather office chair.
"Change the world?! He couldn't change the lightbulb in the breakroom! I wrote all of that code! He took it from me when I went to his office to help HIM!"
"Tsk. Tsk. Jealousy doesn't look good on you Frank. Maybe you should use some of your PTO and take some time off? Spend some time with the wife and kids?"
"I have no wife, nor kids. I have this job and the app I have been working on for the past year and a half." Joe's phone began to ring, so Frank was shooed away with a halfhearted promise to look into things. If Frank was going to be railroaded into taking a backseat while Philip took the credit, he was at least going to expose Philip for who he truly was. If Frank went down, so would Philip.
Frank heard his door open up the narrow staircase behind him. The unmistakable sound of Philip's high end alligator leather loafers squeaking with each step. A low growl passed through his lips, but he quickly composed himself for his uninvited guest. "Philip? What do I owe the… pleasure?" Frank turned casually to the backstabber in his doorway.
"Hey buddy, no hard feelings right? I mean, it's for the good of the company right? Just think of it this way, you are so awkward that if you pitched it they probably would have shot the idea down. But I was able to bring it to life. So in a way, you should thank me right?" He toyed with the stress ball that once sat on Frank's desk. Frank parsed his lips, as he seemed to be doing more and more these days, and still he kept his cool. "Anyway champ, there's a few bugs still in the code that need fixed, and I Googled how to fix them but nothing was showing up for the library you have included. "
"That's because I wrote the library. It is another repository I have. No other library had the capabilities that I needed for this project, so I wrote one." Frank leaned back in his chair, trying not to smirk at the idea of Philip rapidly realizing how in over his head he was.
"Oh cool cool. So you can fix the bugs then. When would you be able to finish that up? I have a presentation in about thirty minutes to give an overview of how it works to the CEO. The CEO man! Crazy right? Anyway, think you could fix it before then? Or at least give me some insight on how you plan to fix it so I can include that in the presentation?" The audacity of the man child before him astounded Frank.
"Sure. Buddy." He tried not to spit through his gritted teeth, "I can't get the issues resolved by then, but maybe I can help with the presentation." He realized as he was explaining to him, this was the perfect opportunity to show just how clueless he is, "So then we will optimize the http calls so that at maximum only five milliseconds pass before it backs up to the cloud."
"So it's not just parsing the file in a different way?" Philip leaned against the far wall, nodding along and moving his hands as if he was rearranging the file himself.
"Not exactly. We are parsing the file, but it's going to tolenquish the files so that it only grabs new things that aren't already on Git and speeds up the processes and time complexity of the program."
"And… What is time complexity again? And tolenquish… That is…?" Frank could almost see the drool dripping out of Philip's mouth when he brought up topics related to the algorithms he used.
"Just trust me on this one. You don't need to understand it to say it." Frank smirked behind a well placed hand. Around 45 minutes later, Frank ventured out of his office to find a bagel in the break room upstairs. It just so happened that the break room was across from the conference room Philip was giving his presentation in. He nibbled the bagel, pretending to savor each bite to bide his time for Philip and the executives to emerge from within. Just as he was getting to the end of his snack, he heard a chorus of hyenas. Looking up from his table, he was dumbfounded. The executives crowded around Philip with praise and cheers, congratulating him on such a profound idea.
"I can't believe you coined the term on the spot! Absolutely brilliant!"
"I love it! It's definitely going to be in my proposals from now on!"
"Ah! Kevin! File this for me, and go pick up my dry cleaning." Frank's branch manager handed a yellow folder to him, not giving a second glance to the shell of a man who waited in anticipation only minutes before.
Frank shuffled to the bathroom to compose himself once more. "How did he do it? Was there a charisma factory explosion when Philip was created? How could he not only talk his way out of that blunder, but turn it around so now every supervisor in a 300 mile radius would be using that dumb word?" He paced around the small bathroom in dismay, pausing only at the sound of an all too familiar voice coming up through the floor. Philip's voice boomed through every surface it came in contact with, especially in his excitement.
"No I mean it bro! They totally loved me! How could they not? I have them eating out of the palm of my hand… No no, of course not… Yeah exactly. Just play it right and I'll be sitting large. Didn't even have to do anything. That dumb sap in the basement practically wrote the presentation for me. He doesn't even care that I took it, and was oh so happy to help when I said I needed the bugs fixed. It's the simping for me." A bellow of laughter filled the room below.
Frank's blood began to boil. Oh so happy? He would show him just how happy he was. An idea began to form, playing into the new found knowledge of Philip's office location to the bathroom above.
After everyone had gone home for the day, Frank crept into Philip's office with a piece of wire from a coat hanger and a wrench from the maintenance closet. He moved the tile directly above Philip's new cloth chair he had received as part of his promotion. Grumbling irritably, Frank loosened a pipe connection just enough to allow dripping when the water pressure was raised if the sink ran or the toilet was flushed. Placing the speckled tile back in place, he used the wire to poke a hole in one of the black specks so the water would have an easy exit, straight down onto Philip's chair. "We'll see which one of us is happy tomorrow." Frank chuckled to himself, closing the office door behind him.
The next morning Frank walked into the building with a bounce in his step and a lilt in his voice. It was going to be a good day. As he passed by Philip's office, he noticed his colleague packing up his belongings in a cardboard box. Pleased with his handiwork, he decided to stop in for a spell. "Morning Philip, everything alright? You didn't get fired did you?"
Philip, who had had his back to the door, turned with a beaming smile. "Actually the opposite! Some crazy leak happened overnight. Ruined my new chair, my tablet on my desk, and even my antique persian rug. Boss man said not to worry about it since maintenance was supposed to go around fixing all these leaks anyway, so they are putting me in a new office they know has been checked. Corner office with a view of Crest Hills Park! Best view in the building man! And Richard said… You know Richard right? Mr. Mitchell? Anyway, Richard said they would replace my chair for me, and anything else damaged in the leak!  And get this! He said it shows just how much this project is needed, so he is expediting the funding to pay me for the overtime outside of work!" Frank's eye twitched in disbelief.
"Really? How… wonderful." He bid his goodbye before he lost the last strand of composure he had.
A month passed in a flash, the app was getting so close to finished that Frank could see the end of the tunnel. Philip was just behind Frank as he came into the building that morning. He did his best to ignore his rambunctious colleague who felt the need to loudly greet everyone he passed. Up ahead, he noticed the branch manager, Mr. Mitchell, stepping on the elevator. Mr. Mitchell shot his hand out to hold the door open. Philip leapt past Frank and scampered into the elevator. "Oh, are employees allowed to use the elevator now?"
"Nope, just me." The arrogant frat boy wannabe shot Frank the finger guns with a devilish grin, "See ya champ, we gotta get up to the big meeting with the Tanaka Group. Maybe one day if you work hard you can sit in on meetings with our biggest clients too." As the doors started to close he threw out yet another remark to set Frank on fire, "Hey maybe you can be promoted to secretary so you can take notes during the meetings!"
Frank had passed the point of calming down. He didn't care what the consequences were, Philip wasn't going to that meeting. He rushed to his basement office, flinging open his laptop in rage. "I told myself I wouldn't stoop this low, but I don't care anymore." Frank was virtually the only person in the IT department left who knew how to log in to the office systems. He navigated to the elevator controls, and abruptly cut all power to the elevator. He promptly closed his laptop, putting the elevator out of his mind and taking half a day PTO like Joe had suggested.
As Frank stepped out of the stairwell onto the fourth floor later that afternoon, a crew of maintenance personnel and fire fighters surrounded the elevator doors, the sounds of clapping fading around them. Mr. Mitchell and Philip were being hugged and some of the women clung to Philip like he had leapt the length of the building to save Mr. Mitchell's life. "Oh Philip!" Mr. Mitchell grabbed Philip by the shoulders and embraced him tightly, "I don't know how I could have made it through that ordeal without you! Please, you have my sincerest thanks, join me at the club tonight for a few holes on the green. My treat."
"Thank you for that kind offer Richard, unfortunately I am not a club member." Philip gave him a look and shrug that Frank knew all too well.
"Oh please, call me Dick. And don't you worry about a membership. After today I'll make sure one is paid up for you, and I'll even give you a company card so you can get a nice set of clubs to bring your A Game." Mr. Mitchell wrapped his arm around Philip in a show of fellowship. "Come now, let's get something to eat. I know you must be starving after such an incident."
At this point Frank was ready to throw his hands up in defeat. No matter what he did, Philip came out on top. He was just too charismatic and charming to go down, and Frank was ready to throw in the towel.
A week and a half later, the day had finally come. Philip tapped his phone quickly, trying to win whatever game held his attention for the moment. Frank looked back to the computer screen in front of him, the app almost finished. In another ten minutes or so, the app would be online and functional, Philip taking all the credit and getting all the overtime hours for it. Another grumbled side glance at Philip showed Frank how little Philip was paying attention or learning the code. They were supposed to be pair programming to finish the app, but also so Philip could learn the structure and understand how to maintain it. Obviously, as per usual, this was not the case.
Frank finished writing a test line of code to call a fake data function for the app. After the data appeared on the server, he switched back to the code segment and deleted the test line. He murmured to Philip that it was finished, and the latter excitedly ran to Mr. Mitchell with the good news. Frank looked forlornly at his code. He spotted a small red squiggly line on a piece of code he knew was correct. "Oh, I must have deleted the semicolon. Better fix that." His finger paused above the keyboard for a moment. His heart racing and his face flushing with excitement once again, "How could I have been so blind?! The solution is so obvious! Any developer with a menial amount of skill should be able to fix the infamous missing semicolon!" His hushed whispers echoed while he frantically searched to verify he was alone, "I accidentally forgot the semicolon. That's it. Easy fix. He should know where we have been working in the files. That idiot won't be able to find the start button in the demonstration today, much less find a missing semicolon. I should have known all along, the easiest way to prove how useless he is would be to make him debug HIS code in front of the executives." Frank committed his changes and pushed the code online, leaning back in his chair with a grin, "Perfect."
Now standing in front of a conference room full of staff, Philip beamed with confidence, holding his finger above the Enter key with a smirk. He stared at the executive onlookers who jittered with anticipation, amused by their enthusiasm. "Finally, I give you… Hedy!" Philip pressed the key to signal the start of the app.
Frank felt himself disappear into the crowd around him as applause erupted from the office staff and executives around the table. Philip really did it. He must have found the bug before the meeting. A small, innocent smile crept onto Frank's face as the applause died down. The app was stuck on a loading screen, moving no further into the user interface than the Hedy logo Frank had designed around his idol.
"What is this?" The CEO, Stan Matthews, gestured to the projector screen with his hand. 
"Um… My apologies sir. Must just be a glitch since it's just starting up. It will be worked out, no problem." Philip shifted uncomfortably from side to side.
"Of course, you know how these things go, there's bound to be a few bugs to be rooted out at launch." Mr. Mitchell patted Philip's back with confidence, "I bet it's something simple, you know Philip. He would never leave an app unfinished or broken. He's just that diligent."
"Um… of… of course. Let's take a look." For the next 20 minutes the crowd watched the projector screen while Philip rifled through the files upon files of code, shooting panicked glances at Frank who pretended not to notice. The executives were growing more and more irritable by the minute, and the facade Philip had crafted so carefully was being torn away with each tick on the wall clock.
"Are you really telling me you brought this here to present as a demonstration, but it's still so full of bugs that you don't know how to fix it?!" Mr. Matthews stood from his seat in a huff.
"No sir! Absolutely not! I just… Maybe the wifi is being finicky or something?" Mr. Matthews picked up his phone to check the wifi signal, holding it out for Philip to see full bars across the top of the screen.
"If this is the talent you boast about in your branch Mr. Mitchell, we need to have a serious look at your staffing judgment." Mr. Matthews buttoned his suit and picked up his suitcase to exit the room.
"Wait sir! Please! I'm sure there is someone here that might be able to help. Um…" Mr. Mitchell scanned the room frantically looking for a savior. "Oh! Um… Kevin!" He snapped his fingers at Frank and ushered him over to the front of the room, "You have a tendency to help your coworkers when they get stuck, correct? Maybe you can take a look at it then?"
Mr. Matthews paused to look at Frank, who nodded in feigned innocence. "If it's alright, may I clone the repository to my laptop? I have several homebrew debugging tools I created to help me in such scenarios."
"Absolutely! Just please fix it." Frank knew he had deleted the repository off of his computer already, in fact Philip had insisted on it since it was supposed to be his project now. Frank hooked his computer to the projector, promptly mirroring his screen on the wall. He navigated to the Github repository where the code was stored, grabbing the link to clone it in the terminal.
Before he could leave the page though, Mr. Matthews stopped him, "Wait a minute." He paused as if to reread the screen, "What is that?" He pointed to the name of a user on the screen, the user who had written the last commit actually, "Who is Frank Strong?" Frank looked at the screen, realizing he didn't need to show the supervisors and executives how dumb Philip was. He just needed to show them the commit history since it would display the user that created every commit save.
"That would be me sir." Frank held up his hand shyly.
Mr. Mitchell stepped back in confusion. "You've already worked on this project before?" Mr. Matthews came to the front of the room and took control of the laptop without much protest. He looked at the commit history, and there it was. Plain as day. Not a single line written by anyone other than Frank.
After Philip was dismissed from the grounds and Frank had fixed the semicolon to make the app run perfectly, Mr. Mitchell stopped Frank on his way home for the day. "Frank, why didn't you come to us sooner, we would have put a stop to it immediately."
Frank rubbed the back of his neck, trying not to make a scene about going to Joe on the first day but being shooed away. Thinking quickly about how all of this came to be, a wonderful idea formed in the back of his mind. "Well sir, while I was sad about Philip taking the credit, I accepted what had been done and proceeded to help finish the app."
"Why in the world would you do that?!"
"I mean, it was for the good of the company right?" Frank feigned innocence once more with a tiny smile, taking a page from the thief himself.
